# UAE_PedObesity
This project aimed to test whether associations observed in Pearce et al., (2018) could be replicated in children and adolescents from the UAE. In the US, pediatric obesity is associated with lower socio-economic status, which is also associated with difference in cognitive functioning and mental health. In contrast, pediatric obesity in the UAE is not associated with socio-economic status, thus, may not show the same associations with cognitive functioning observed in the US.
