There were no differences by sex with the exception of females having a higher hip-to-waist ratio, which would be expected for this age range.

## By Weight Status

We decided to use the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) designation of weight status for the sample. They use smoothed, sex-specific BMI curves meant to match the the BMI cutoffs for overweight (OW; 25 $kg/m^2$) and obesity (OB; 30 $kg/m^2$) at age 18 yrs.

Rather than BMI-zscore or BMI-percentile, we chose to use percent of overweight cutoff because recent studies shows it has a tighter association with measured adiposity:

BMI $\%$ of overweight = $\frac{child BMI}{BMI\: at\: age-\: and\: sex-\: adjusted\: overweight\: cutoff}*100$

<100 $\%$ - indicates child BMI is below the overweight cutoff for age and sex (i.e., has healthy weight)
100 $\%$ - indicates child BMI is the same as the overweight cutoff for age and sex
>100 $\%$ - indicates child BMI is above the overweight cutoff for age and sex (i.e., has overweight or obesity)

A one-way ANOVA showed a main effect of weight status for age. Post-hoc t-tests show that those with obesity were older on average than those with healthy weight (t(75) = -3.05, p = 0.003). There were no differences in age between those with overweight and healthy weight (t(63) = -1.59, p = 117) or obesity and overweight (t(62) = -1.33, p = 188). 

There were also main effects of weight status for BMI and percent of overweight cutoff. Post-hoc tests show differences in expected direction such that both BMI and percent of overweight cutoff were greater for those with obesity than overweight (BMI: t(47) = -8.65, p < 0.001; percent of overweight: t(40) = -9.35, p < 0.001) or healthy weight (BMI: t(43) = -14.38, p < 0.001; percent of overweight: t(43) = -14.87, p < 0.001) and were greater in those with overweight than healthy weight (BMI: t(59) = -11.29, p < 0.001; percent of overweight: t(67) = -15.76, p < 0.001).

There was no main effect of weight status in hip-to-waist ratio or in any other demographic characteristics. In particular, there were no differences by mother or father educational level or by SES.

Only child age was associated with percent of overweight cutoff - older children tended to have higher percent of overweight cutoff indicating older children were more likely to have overweight or obesity. There was no association with father or mother education level, which differs from finding in the US. Hip to waist ratio was also not associated with percent of overweight cutoff,

In Demographics Table by Weight Status, there was no difference in monthly income by weight status. To double check we also ran a one-way ANOVA to test if percent of overweight differed by monthly incomes - there were no differences.

Fisher test indicated that the distribution of participants with a family history of obesity differed by weight status such that 89% and 72% of those with obesity or overweight, respectively, have a family history of obesity. The number of different family relationship categories that had obesity was also different by weight status. Post-hoc tests show that those with obesity had a greater number of family relationships with a history of obesity relative to those with overweight (t(63) = -3.10, p = 0.003) or healthy weight (t(76) = -2.90, p = 0.005) but there was no difference between those with overweight or healthy weight (t(67) = -0.25, p = 0.834).

There was no differences in percent of overweight for those whose families had a history of eating disorder (reported by parent). There was a significant difference in percent of overweight between families that reported a history of obesity ('Yes') and those who did not ('No'). Those without a family history of obesity had a mean percent of overweight equal to 94%, indicating the children had healthy weight on average. Children with a family history of obesity had a mean percent of overweight equal to 124%, indicating the children had overweight or obesity.

```

After controlling for family income, mother education, child age, and child sex, percent of overweight was positively associated with number of family members with obesity. For each increase in percent of overweight above 100%, there was a 1% increase in the number of family members with obesity. In other words we would expect and 10% increase in number of family members with obesity if the child had a BMI that was 110% of their age- and sex- adjusted cutoff for overweight.

Fisher test indicated that the distribution of participants differed by weight status for hours of video/computer game use, though the pattern is not straight forward - may need to discuss other categorization approaches. 

One-way ANOVAs also indicated that parent-reported Sleep Onset Delay and Sleep Disordered Breathing differed by weight status. Post-hoc tests show that those with obesity had a greater sleep onset delay and sleep disordered breathing compared to those with healthy weight (sleep onset: t(63) = -3.01, p = 0.004; sleep breathing: t(62) = -2.79, p = 0.007) or healthy weight (t(76) = -2.90, p = 0.005). While sleep onset delay was also greater in those with obesity than overweight (sleep onset: t(56) = -2.06, p = 0.044) there was no difference for sleep disordered breathing (t(54) = -1.51, p = 0.137). There were no differences between those with overweight and healthy weight for sleep onset (t(46) = -0.543, p = 0.610) or sleep disordered breathing (t(52) = -1.12, p = 0.270).

### Summary

No evidence for an association between percent of overweight or interaction with sex for Emotional, Conduct, Hyperactivity, or Pro-social problems. Only peer problems were associated with a weight status by sex interaction indicating girls experience more peer problems than boys when they have very high levels of excess weight.

1) I can look by obesity status (e.g., healthy weight vs overweight vs obese)

Percent of IOTF overweight cuttoff (BMI 25 equivalency - BMI25p) is centered at 100\% (right at overweight cuttoff). The Effect of SES indicates that moving from <25,000 AED to >75,000 AED is assoicated with 8 point increase in Block T-score. Age, Mother Educuation, and Sex were not associated with Block T-score. There is a significant quadratic effect such that for one point increase in BMI25p (1 more percent over cuttoff), the association between BMI25p and BlockT decreases by .19 points (twice the quadratic coefficient). If we scale differently, each 10 point increase in BMI125p results in the slope between BMI25p dreasing by almost 2 points. This means the initial positive slope between BMI25p and Block performance becomes zero at BMI25p 99.2 ( linear/2xquadratic and then add 100 to undo centering) and then starts becoming negative as BMI25p increases. This indicates that higher weight status is assoicated with better Block performance up to the level of overweight and then heigher weight status starts to become associated with worse performance. When remove those with performance IQ <70 quadratic effect is p = 0.052.

The Effect of SES indicates that moving from <25,000 AED to >75,000 AED is assoicated with 9 point increase in Matrix T-score. Age, Mother Educuation, and Sex were not associated with Block T-score.

The Effect of SES indicates that moving from <25,000 AED to >75,000 AED is assoicated with 15 point increase in Overall Performance IQ. There are trend level effects for increasing from <25,000 AED to 25,000-55,000 AED and to 55,000-75,000 such that the increases in income are associated with 5 and 10 point increases in Performance IQ. Age, Mother Educuation, and Sex were not associated with Performance IQ. There was a trend level quadratic effect such that for each one point increase in BMI25p (1 more percent over cuttoff), the association between BMI25p and Performance IQ decreases by .24 points (twice the quadratic coefficient). If we scale differently, each 10 point increase in BMI125p results in the slope between BMI25p dreasing by 2.4 points. This means the initial positive slope between BMI25p and Block performance becomes zero at BMI25p 100.9 ( linear/2xquadratic and then add 100 to undo centering) and then starts becoming negative as BMI25p increases. This indicates that higher weight status is assoicated with better Block performance up to the level of overweight and then heigher weight status starts to become associated with worse performance. When remove those with performance IQ <70 quadratic effect is p = 0.082.
